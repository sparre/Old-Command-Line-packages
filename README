Old Command-Line packages [1]
=============================

This is my old set of command-line processing packages.  Please consider
them almost obsolescent.  I am in the planning phase for a replacement,
which is intended to intrude less on the sources of the actual
application.


Included tests
--------------

The repository comes with two ready-to-use test cases:

1) 'cyclomatic_complexity' - reports excessive cyclomatic complexities in the
   project sources.

2) 'unused_units' - warns about units which aren't compiled.

If you want to find free Ada tools or libraries AdaIC [2] is an excellent
starting point.  You can also take a look at my other source text
repositories [3] or my web site [4].
